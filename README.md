## üöÄ Excel Macro Runner (Hybrid Local Architecture)

This setup allows you to run Excel macros on a local Windows machine using `xlwings`, triggered by Docker-based orchestration.

### üìÅ Project Structure

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hybrid_local/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watcher.py           # Host-side macro executor
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile           # Containerized job sender
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_macro.py         # Writes job instructions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job_config.json      # Sample macro job config
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start_watcher.bat    # Launch the watcher on Windows
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml   # Docker orchestration setup

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

#### 1. Prepare Shared Directory
Create a local shared folder on your Windows host (e.g. `C:\shared`) and ensure Docker Desktop has access to it.

#### 2. Install Requirements on Host
- Excel (Office 365, LTSC, or equivalent)
- Python 3.x
- `pip install xlwings`

#### 3. Run Watcher
From the Windows host:
```bash
start start_watcher.bat
```

#### 4. Run the Docker Container
From your project root:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### 5. Results
- Job is written by Docker to `/shared/job_config.json`
- `watcher.py` picks it up, runs the macro, and renames the job file
- Output Excel file is updated in the shared folder

### ‚úÖ Notes
- This approach supports **only one macro job at a time**.
- Parallel execution would require multiple user sessions or Windows VMs.

### üì¶ Packaging
To package:
- Zip the `project/hybrid_local/` folder for distribution
- Include README as documentation
